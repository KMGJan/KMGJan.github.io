    "text": "Niche partitioning between planktivorous fish in the pelagic Baltic Sea assessed by DNA metabarcoding, qPCR and microscopy\nTo guide management strategies, a detailed understanding of the food web interactions and dynamics at high taxonomy resolution is required. However, due to method limitations, the diet of small pelagic fish is overrepresented by mesozooplankton with hard parts, while smaller and soft bodied organisms are seldom considered as prey. This project aimed to validate the use of molecular tools for studying plankton-fish interactions, using microscopy, qPCR and DNA metabarcoding on the 18S rRNA and COI gene to capture their whole eukaryotic prey assemblage. This was hypothesized to address this main limitation, allowing the identification of the diet of the three main planktivorous mesopredators in the Baltic Sea, sprat, herring, and stickleback. This project highlight the strength of using molecular tools for trophic interaction studies and highlight niche partitionning across clupeids (herring and sprat) and stickleback. Rotifer was identified as prefered prey for stickleback, whereas the copepod Pseudocalanus was prefered by clupeids.\nThe full article is available in open access: Novotny, A., Jan, K.M.G., Dierking, J., Winder, M.

Planktivorous fish are key components of the pelagic food web as they support upper trophic levels, such as commercially important fish, and indirectly control algal growth by feeding on zooplankton. In this project, DNA metabarcoding on low levels of dietary DNA and modeling will be used to investigate the full prey spectrum of planktivorous fish. The outcome of the studies will provide a better understanding on the plankton-fish interactions and help predict the variation of energy flow from primary producer to fish under different scenarios.\nThe project is conducted at the Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences, Stockholm University and is funded by FORMAS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking Project I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking Project II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking Project III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking Project IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nPublications"

    "text": "Limited resource use overlaps among small pelagic fish species in the central Baltic Sea\nSmall pelagic fish have a central position in pelagic food webs, linking plankton production to higher trophic levels. They often favour crustacean mesozooplankton and are thought to compete for the same resource, an assumption that relies on microscopy diet identification that neglects digested and soft-bodied prey. Here, we aimed to systematically identify the entire resource use and overlap among the dominant small pelagic fish in the central Baltic Sea at high taxonomy resolution. The diet composition of two clupeid species, herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were assessed in May and October using DNA metabarcoding, stable isotopes and microscopy. All three methods gave consistent results. The clupeids shared a similar diet in May when prey diversity is low, composed mainly of the copepods Pseudocalanus and Acartia, whereas three-spined stickleback favoured different copepod species and the rotifer Synchaeta, which was confirmed by a different isotopic value as compared to the two clupeids. In October, all forage fish preyed on diverse zooplankton species, mainly composed of the copepods Acartia, Eurytemora and Temora, while Pseudocalanus was only important for herring. The observed resource use partitioning between sprat and herring was confirmed by the stable isotope values from October, suggesting that different prey species were targeted during the summer period. Our study highlights that resource use overlaps among small pelagic fish was limited and varied with prey availability. This suggests that shifts in zooplankton dynamics, rather than competition for resources, has the potential to drive small pelagic fish population fluctuations.\nThe full article is available in open access: Jan, K.M.G., Hentati-Sundberg, J., Larson, N., Winder, M.

    "text": "Plankton blooms over the annual cycle shape trophic interactions under climate change\nPlankton dynamics and interactions shape energy fluxes in aquatic food webs. Understanding plankton phenology and their responses to their changing environment is crucial to predict cascading effects up to higher trophic levels. In this study, we use 15 years of plankton monitoring data to identify trends and drivers of timing and magnitude of bloom-forming phyto- and zooplankton taxa in the Baltic Sea. Our results show that copepods peak in synchrony with the summer cyanobacterial bloom and are decoupled from the highly productive spring phytoplankton blooms that tend to appear earlier. Driven by the offset with spring phytoplankton bloom, magnitudes of Pseudocalanus, an important copepod prey for fish, has decreased over the study period. Being coupled to the spring phytoplankton, the bloom magnitude of the rotifer Synchaeta was also driven by the offset with the spring bloom. These two zooplankton have an important role in niche differentiation for planktivorous fish, thus earlier spring bloom might affect transfer efficiencies to higher trophic levels. We also find an extension of the productive season with newly developing diatom blooms in autumn, supporting secondary production later in the season. We show that multiple phytoplankton blooms support zooplankton production over the annual cycle and further challenge the assumption that zooplankton follow synchronously spring phytoplankton dynamics. While responses to climate vary among and within plankton functional group with implication for higher trophic levels, this study stresses that plankton phenologies need to be considered over the entire annual cycle to project climate change implication on species interactions and energy flow at the base of the pelagic food web.\nA popular science summary can be found here.\nThe full article is available in open access: Jan, K.M.G., Serandour, B., Walve, J., Winder, M.
